## 2048 Game Instructions

### Objective:
Combine numbered tiles by sliding them in one of the four directions. The goal is to reach the **2048** tile!
Once reached **2048** continue to make **BIGGER TILES**!

### ðŸŽ® Controls:
- **Arrow Keys**: Move tiles up, down, left, or right.
- **W, A, S, D**: Alternative controls.
- **Buttons**: For mobile users, swipe is not available because the page is scrollable. But buttons are provided below for **UP, DOWN, LEFT** and **RIGHT**.

### ðŸ”® Gameplay Rules:
1. Each move spawns a new tile with a value of **2**, **4**, or **8**.
2. Tiles move in the selected direction until they collide with another tile or the board edge.
3. If two tiles of the same number collide, they merge into one, doubling their value.
4. You win when you reach the **2048** tile!
5. The game ends when no moves are possible.

### ðŸ”„ Advanced Mechanics:
- **Tile Generation Chances:**  
  - 70% chance for a **2**  
  - 29.5% chance for a **4**  
  - 0.5% chance for an **8**!  
- After the **2048** tile, further tiles will follow the same style.

### ðŸš€ Tips and Strategies:
- Keep your highest-numbered tile in a corner.
- Build numbers in one direction to maximize merges.
- Think ahead and anticipate possible moves.
